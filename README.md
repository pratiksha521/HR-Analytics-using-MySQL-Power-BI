# HR-Analytics-using-MySQL-Power-BI
## Objective:
The purpose of this project is to help an organization to improve employee performance and reduce attrition by creating an HR analytics dashboard. The dashboard provides valuable insights into employee data, which can be used to make data-driven decisions and improve employee satisfaction and retention.
## Data Cleaning and Processing: 
Several steps were taken to prepare the data for analysis. Null values were removed and duplicate values were eliminated. Spelling errors were identified and corrected, and appropriate data types were assigned. Additionally, a conditional column was added for attrition count, which assigned a value of 1 for 'yes' and 0 for 'no' based on the attrition column. Furthermore, a new measure was created to calculate the attrition rate, which was derived by dividing the total attrition count by the total employee count.
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
To start the analysis, I have identified the key performance indicators (KPIs) to track and monitor employee performance and attrition. The following KPIs were created with card visualizations in Power BI:

1)  Overall Employee
2) Attrition count
3) Attrition rate
4) Active Employee
5) Average age

I have used several charts and visualizations to gain insights into the employee data. Here are some of the key insights gained from the analysis:
1) Tree map chart: The chart showed the distribution of attrition by gender. The data showed that 150 males and 87 females had left the company, indicating that male employees were leaving the company more than female employees.
2) Pie chart: The chart displayed the attrition count by Department. The data showed that the attrition count was highest in the R&D Department, with 56.12% of employees leaving, followed by the Sales Department, with 38.82% of employees leaving.
3) Stacked column chart: The chart showed the number of employee by age group. The data revealed that the age group from 25-34 had the highest employee count of 337.
4) Matrix table: The table displayed job roles by job satisfaction scores, highlighting the big numbers in dark green. The data showed that Sales Executive had the highest employee count, followed by research scientists and laboratory technicians.
5) Stacked bar chart: The chart displayed the attrition count by education field. The data showed that the attrition count was highest in the Life Sciences field of employees leaving, followed by the Medical Field of employees leaving.
6) Donut charts: The chart displayed the Attrition rate by gender for different age group. The data revealed that the age group from 25-34 had the highest attrition count of 112.
